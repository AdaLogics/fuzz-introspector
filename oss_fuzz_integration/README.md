# OSS-Fuzz integration

The easiest way to test the introspector is to integrate it with OSS-Fuzz
and use the OSS-Fuzz infrastructure to help with fuzzing tasks. To do this
we have patches and scripts to automate this process. 

Notice that these scripts will build a new version of your OSS-Fuzz Docker
images, so preferably build things on a separate system or be prepared to
rebuild images when you switch between fuzz-introspector-images and original
oss-fuzz images. The reason we have to rebuild the images is we need to make
a small patch to Clang due to the following issue: https://reviews.llvm.org/D77704

## Build the patched OSS-Fuzz
From within this directory, run the command:
```
./build_patched_oss_fuzz.sh
```

This will download OSS-Fuzz, apply our patches and build the Docker images.

## Run the introspector
Following the above instructions, you can use the following command to perform
a complete run of the introspector, including with coverage analysis.


```
cd oss-fuzz
../run_both.sh htslib 30
cd corpus-0/inspector-report/
python3 -m http.server 8008
```

You can now navigate to `http://localhost:8008/fuzz_report.html`

Notice that when running these commands the `run_both.sh` script will use
OSS-Fuzz to generate coverage. This will result in a webserver being launched
and you will have to exit that server. So, when the following output happens
please use ctrl-c to exit it:
